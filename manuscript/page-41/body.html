Choose the rake you are going to use. Knit a piece 6 or 12 inches wide. Make a note of the number of nails it takes. With this as a guide it will not be difficult to estimate the amount of yarn needed for any of the patterns in this pamphlet. It is always better to get a little too much than not to have</p></div> </div>
