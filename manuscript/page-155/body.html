Then every five rows, every four rows, every three rows, every two rows, until the sleeve is long enough (about 18 to 22 inches) and narrow enough at the cuff (about 8 inches). On the very last row at this point three nails should be dropped altogether on each side of the sleeve. Watch carefully the shaping of the sleeve as you narrow so as not to get it too tight at any point.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Change to triple cross-stitch by winding once across</li></ul></div> </div>
