This corresponds to the first “slipped stitch” in knitting with needles.</p><p>Care must be taken to do this after each row of stitches has been lifted over the nails. As the knitting grows it can also be gently pulled through from the other side of the rake.</p><p>Be sure always to take a stitch first from one row of nails and then from the other.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
