Our ex-service patients in the army and public health service hospitals have seized upon the principle of this toy, and have applied it in making “rakes” of various sizes on which they have “knitted” a large number of articles, from silk neckties to wool shawls, caps, sweaters and capes. They have found real interest and pleasure in this pastime. The patient flat on his back in a plaster cast, sometimes with the use of only one hand, has been able to make garments as attractive and well-made as the man who is up and about."
