<h4 id="preface">PREFACE.</h4>
<p>Who does not remember the spool-knitter of his childhood, perhaps a home made affair—a large empty spool with four wire brads driven in around the opening at one end—on which one made an endless rope of colored yarns, to use, maybe, for reins when playing horse. Our ex-service patients in the army and public health service hospitals have seized upon the principle of this toy, and have applied it in making “rakes” of various sizes on which they have “knitted” a large number of articles, from silk neckties to wool shawls, caps, sweaters and capes. They have found real interest and pleasure in this pastime. The patient flat on his back in a plaster cast, sometimes with the use of only one hand, has been able to make garments as attractive and well-made as the man who is up and about.</p>
<p>The results of their experiments in “rake knitting” have been so very worth while, that I have wanted to make them available for the use of the sick and convalescent everywhere. Therefore I have prepared this pamphlet of patterns. It does not pretend to exhaust the possibilities of “rake knitting,” but merely offers a few patterns which have been used successfully in knitting with two and four-fold yarn.</p>
<p>Special thanks are due the patients of Kenilworth Hospital, U. S. P. H. S., Biltmore, N. C., who worked out some of these patterns and allowed me to photograph some of their finished work.</p>

<p>Fig. 4. Rakes.</p>
<p>Yellow poplar or red gum makes a rake that is light to handle, and holds the nails securely.</p>
<p>Select well-seasoned lumber, free from knots, about ¾ to ⅞ inch thick. Rakes made from thinner wood give in the middle and are not satisfactory.</p>
<p>The opening within the rake can be cut out with a keyhole saw, or better still with a jig saw or a band saw, if such is available.</p>
<p>The rakes must be well-planed and sandpapered, and no roughness left anywhere to catch the wool when knitting.</p>
<p><em>The dimensions for the rakes are given in Figs. , .</em></p>
<p>The long rakes  are set with 1 inch finishing nails or with 1 inch, No. 16 wire brads. The nails must be set carefully as indicated in the drawing and project evenly ⅜ inch above the surface of the wood.</p>
<p>The small double round rake  is set with 1 inch finishing nails.</p>
<p>The large round rake  is set with 1½ inch No. 10 wire brads, or with wooden pegs whittled from ⅜ inch doweling, leaving a small head to prevent the yarn from slipping off too easily. The pegs should be securely glued into holes drilled just the right size to take them. Many patients prefer the wooden pegs in the round rakes. Such a rake was sold in some stores during the war and used for knitting hospital stockings to cover surgical dressings.</p>
<p><img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="Fig. 5—Nutpick. Fig. 6"></p>
<p>For a <em>pick</em>, an ordinary nutpick,  will serve very well, or one can be made from a 3 inch finishing nail, set in a wooden handle, bent and filed into shape as shown in , and finished with emery cloth, and oil and pumice.</p>

<li>WINDING A LONG RAKE.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Three different stitches are commonly used in rake knitting.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Single or plain stitch—.</li>
<li>Double or cross-stitch—.</li>
<li>Triple cross-stitch—.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>To Cast Stitches on a Long Rake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the long rake, shown in , with nails set ½ inch apart, in rows ¾ inch apart.</p>
<p>Drive a thumb tack or a carpet tack into the side of the rake near each end until the head is just a little above the surface of the wood. This is to hold the yarn after winding.</p>
<p><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Fig. 10. First Winding.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>First Winding.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The same for all stitches.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tie yarn to nail A, leaving an end 3 or 4 inches long which is slipped through the opening of the rake. Let the rake rest in the left hand. With the right hand wind the yarn around the nails as shown in the diagram. Do not pull the yarn too tight; just hold it easily between thumb and finger. When the last nail (B) is reached, wrap the yarn once around the tack to hold it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Draw the smooth flat side of the pick rapidly down the length of the rake between the rows of nails. This pushes the yarn to the bottom of the nails, and leaves space above for the second winding of yarn.</p>
</li>

<hr>
<h4 id="second-winding">Second Winding.</h4>
<p><em>In single or plain stitch,  do not cross the yarn.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first winding ended at B with the last cross at C.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wind the yarn around D and E without crossing it, and so on back to the end of the rake where the first winding began. Wrap the yarn around the tack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The yarn has passed twice in front of each nail with the exception of nail B.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the pick lift the lower thread (first winding) over the upper thread, (second winding) and off the nail. Do not stretch the yarn more than just enough to lift it over the head of the nail. Do this at each nail along one side, then along the other, leaving out the nail B which has just one thread. This completes the first row of stitches.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Draw the smooth flat side of the pick rapidly down the length of the rake between the rows of nails to push down the yarn, and make room for the next winding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Second Winding—Continued.</li>
</ul>
<p>_In double or cross-stitch. _</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The second winding is the same as the first winding; that is, the yarn is crossed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the pick lift the lower thread over the upper thread as in single or plain stitch. This completes the first row of stitches.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Draw the smooth flat side of the pick along between the rows of nails to make space for the next winding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>_Triple cross-stitch. _</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wind once over and back as if for double or cross-stitch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wind the yarn a third time across the rake, crossing it as in the first and second winding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Three threads now pass in front of each nail except A and B. Lift the lower thread (first winding) over the upper two threads and off the nail. Do this at all the nails except A and B. This completes the first row of stitches.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Push threads to the bottom of the nails by drawing the smooth flat side of the pick rapidly along between the rows of nails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the second row of stitches, wind once across the rake, and lift the lower thread off as described above. Push threads to the bottom of the nails, and wind back over the rake for the third row of stitches, and so on.</p>

<p>The round cap rakes (illustrated) are wound according to the following directions:</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="round-cap-rake">Round Cap Rake</h4>
<p>Stitches are cast on this round rake in the same way as on the long rake described in , except that the winding continues around the rake.</p>
<p>Single or double stitch may be used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tie the yarn to one of the nails.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wind once around the rake as directed in  for the first winding, until the nail to which the yarn is tied is reached again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continue winding until this nail is reached a second time, that is, until two threads pass in front of each nail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wrap yarn around a thumb tack in the side of the rake.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lift the lower thread (first winding) over the upper thread (second winding) and off the nails. When only one thread remains around each nail, run the smooth flat side of the pick around between the rows of nails to push down the threads, and make room for the next winding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continue by winding once around the rake; that is, until two threads again pass in front of each nail. Lift the lower thread over the upper thread and off the nails to complete the row of stitches.</p>

<h4 id="round-cap-rake-1">Round Cap Rake</h4>
<p>To knit a cap on this rake the single stitch is used, as a rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To cast on stitches, tie yarn to a nail, , and wind to the left, until nail A is reached again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then, holding the yarn in the left hand, pass it along in front of nail A, and above the first winding, and lift the lower thread on the nail over the upper and off the nail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Move the rake around a little until the yarn held in the left hand passes in front of nail B. Be sure it is above the thread already on the nail. Lift lower thread over the upper thread and off the nail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continue in this way around and around the rake until the knitting of the cap is complete. The pattern for a cap is described in .</p>

<h3 id="general-instructions">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Change from Single or Double Stitch to Triple Stitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wind across the rake and back, crossing the yarn. There are now three threads on the nails. Lift the lowest thread over the upper two threads and off the nails.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Change from Triple Stitch to Single or Double Stitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lift the lower two threads together over the upper thread and off the nails.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Cast Off Stitches in Shaping Garments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lift the stitch from one nail onto the next in the other row.</p>
<p>Lift the stitch already on this nail over the new one, and off the nail.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Add Stitches in Shaping Garments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wind one or more of the empty nails according to directions, when the end of the row of stitches is reached. Wind back across the rake and knit these new stitches in the same way as the others.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Cast Off Knitting from the Rake.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to do this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave a length of yarn, when cutting off the ball, long enough to knit once across the rake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beginning at the opposite end of the rake, with a large knitting needle lift a stitch first from one row of nails and then from the other until all the stitches are on the needle.</p>
<p>Then cast off as in ordinary knitting. (See directions in any book on knitting.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Another way is to take off the stitch from the first nail with a crochet hook, then the stitch from the first nail in the other row, and draw this one through the stitch already on the hook. Then take off the next and draw it through the stitch on the hook, and so on until all the stitches have been crocheted from the rake.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be found that sometimes, with certain yarns, this makes a very tight edge. In this case it is better to use the length of yarn left hanging, and having lifted off two stitches, instead of drawing the second through the first, draw a loop of the yarn through both, leaving this loop on the hook. (This is called a slip stitch.) Take off the next stitch and repeat. Continue until all the stitches have been crocheted from the rake.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Take Up the Loose Stitches at the Beginning of the Knitting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examine a piece of knitting that has just been cast off the rake.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the last row is much tighter than the first.</p>
<p>To take up these loose stitches at the beginning, crochet once across, using the slip stitch described in paragraph 2 of  of this chapter.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Sew Garments Together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use one strand of yarn and a short darning or tapestry needle. Match the stitches, take up one thread on each side, and do not draw the yarn too tightly.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Make Buttonholes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cast stitches off two to six nails, depending on the size of the buttonhole to be made, beginning at the sixth nail from the edge. Add these nails again in the very next row of knitting.</p>
<p>Crochet around the buttonholes with a single stitch or finish with a buttonhole stitch, using one strand of yarn.</p>
<p>Loops may be made instead of buttonholes by crocheting along the edge to be fastened, leaving loops of chain-stitch long enough to go over the button.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Determine the Quantity of Yarn Required for Any Pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some yarns work up more quickly than others, and some stretch more.</p>
<p>This difference in yarns makes it impossible to give exact quantities required for any pattern which would apply to all brands of yarn, or to give the exact number of nails that must be used to knit a given width.</p>
<p>Therefore the size of the finished garment is indicated instead. Where a quantity is given, it is only approximately estimated from the kinds of yarn I have used.</p>
<p>Select a good brand of yarn, and find out by experiment how far one ounce will go. Choose the rake you are going to use. Knit a piece 6 or 12 inches wide. Make a note of the number of nails it takes. With this as a guide it will not be difficult to estimate the amount of yarn needed for any of the patterns in this pamphlet. It is always better to get a little too much than not to have enough. It is often difficult to match a yarn, particularly at local stores.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Adapt the Patterns for Smaller or Larger Garments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The measurements are given on each pattern. It will readily be seen that these can be changed to make the garment smaller or larger.</p>
<p>Having made the experiment suggested in , and having found out how many nails it takes to knit a piece 6 or 12 inches wide, with a given kind of yarn, it will not be difficult to find out how many nails to use in knitting the size garment desired.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>How to Make Other Patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost any simple, straight-line garment can be knitted on a rake.</p>
<p>Make an outline drawing of the garment as it will look before the seams are sewed together.</p>
<p>Decide upon the measurements, length, width, etc.</p>
<p>Having made the experiment suggested in , it will not be difficult to work out the new pattern.</p>

<h3 id="harmonious-combinations-of-colors-in-shawls">HARMONIOUS COMBINATIONS OF COLORS IN SHAWLS.</h3>
<p>In planning the colors to be used in a shawl or scarf, the Standard Color Card of America will be found very helpful. This may be obtained from the Textile Color Card Association of the United States, Inc., 315 Fourth avenue, New York. The card contains 133 standard colors, and is being very widely used in every branch of industry interested in color. The manufacturers of knitting yarns have based their standard colors on this card, which is so well-known among dealers throughout the country that it is possible to order a color by its name and number, stating that these have been taken from the standard color card. The Textile Color Card Association is very glad to give full information concerning the color card and its use.</p>
<p>Some of the color arrangements in the following pages have been taken from this color card.</p>
<p>Where the standard trade name for a color is not commonly known, I have given the more usual descriptive name.</p>
<p>The colors are lettered to correspond to the letters used in the diagrams, the main color of the shawl being called the ground color.</p>
<p>Where strongly contrasted colors are used, a narrow line of black (one or two rows of knitting) between the colors will help to harmonize them.</p>
<p>The following suggested color combinations are only a few of the many good combinations of colors which may be used.</p>

<p>As the knitting proceeds it will be found that a nail at one end or the other is left with only one thread each time the yarn passes over and back. This corresponds to the first “slipped stitch” in knitting with needles.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to do this after each row of stitches has been lifted over the nails. As the knitting grows it can also be gently pulled through from the other side of the rake.</p>
<p>Be sure always to take a stitch first from one row of nails and then from the other.</p>
